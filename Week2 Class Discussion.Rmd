## Built in data sets

R includes many built-in datasets. We saw this with the **MPG** and **diamods** datasets that are used in the *R for Data Science* book.

You can see all the datasets in the **The R Datasets Package** with the following command:

```{r datasets, echo=TRUE}
data()
```

Often, other packages will include their own datasets.

For example, the textbook *Data Analysis and Graphics Using R* has a number of datasets and we can look those in the packages **DAAG** and **MASS** used in their textbook using the following command:

```{r echo=TRUE}
data(package = "DAAG")
data(package = "MASS")
```

Lots of data to work with... If you're tring to find information about a particular type of analysis, someone has probaly already worked out many of the details. (Of course, it may not use the most recent additions to R (i.e. the **tidyverrse** package, but it can be a good place to start.))

## How do I view the data?

There are two ways to view data: using the View() function, just typing the name of the dataset into the console window.

```{r}
library("DAAG")
View(greatLakes) # requires library("DAAG")
greatLakes
```

This is a timeseries dataset (more on that later). We can try to convert it to a tibble (data frame) using the as.tibble() function

```{r convert to a table}
gL <- as.tibble(greatLakes)
gL
```

We see that we've lost the year information (this was automatically generated in the time series data set... so we'd want to add that back at somepoint)

```{r histogram of Lake Erie}
ggplot(data = gL) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(Erie), bins = 50)
```

If I want info on the dataset, I use the following command:
```{r info on greatLakes}
?greatLakes
```


As much a I like ggplot(), if I want to look at TS data, I'll need to use the base graphics plot()
```{r plot of greatLakes data}
plot(greatLakes)
```
